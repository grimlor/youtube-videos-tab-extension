# Extension Icons

Place the extension icons in this directory:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16px (toolbar icon)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48px (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128px (Chrome Web Store)

Icons should represent YouTube's Videos tab or a similar concept related to video content navigation.

## Temporary Placeholder

Until proper icons are created, you can use simple colored squares or generate icons using any icon creation tool.
